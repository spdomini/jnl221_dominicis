Public dataset #1

First <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/foi/new-york-city-17/travel-report-141181/#file-1294924 /" target="_blank">dataset</a> 

<ol>
<li><strong>How is this data organized and collected?</strong></li>

The data has been collected by the Mayor’s Office using a series of travel itineraries and receipts correlating to purchases made by New York City mayor Eric Adams. The data is then organized by factors such as departure and return date, destination, expenditure type, funding source, funder/sponsor, cost, and notes. The data also includes details as to the purpose of Eric Adams’ trips. More specifically, at the top of each individual data sheet, there is a number that correlates to the order of the itineraries.

<li><strong>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</strong></li>

This data is newsworthy as it allows citizens of New York City to gain insight as to where and how money secreted from the city is being spent on the current mayor. As the mayor of the largest city in the United States, the purchasing being made by the mayor directly impacts a significant portion of the country.  Moreover, conflict emerges as citizens may disagree with how their city’s money is being spent (luxury hotels vs minimum, private travel vs commercial). This data is also impactful, as many of the trips are paid for by taxes. With tax rates being some of the highest in New York City, there is a lot of interest as to why residents pay higher amounts, and where the money is specifically going. 

Furthermore, in relation to current events, Eric Adams has previously campaigned on bettering the New York City economy. On September 19th, 2025, Eric Adams suggested that new casinos would be bringing in “billions” to the economy. With these new developments, this data is newsworthy as most citizens desire an understanding of where their cities’ money is being allocated. In the case of this data, citizens can see that most trips being taken by the mayor are paid for by the city. While projects such as the casinos are intended to bring money into the city, conflict arises as the data reveals citizens won’t be seeing the entirety of the funding, as it is a likely source of funding for more governmental usage. 

A good audience for this would be New York City residents who pay taxes, as they will be interested to see how the mayor is using them regarding his travels. In considering this audience and this data, it is important to include both supporters of Adams, and those in opposition, as well as those who can speak about economic conditions of the past and how the current mayor’s performance is comparing.

<li><strong>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</strong></li>
Paying for flights makes up more than half of the costs paid for by the city in order to fund travels for New York City mayor Eric Adams.

Public dataset #2

How is this <a href="https://data.syr.gov/datasets/92bcecf4355140a98b9bba3cd8ecdca2_0/explore?location=42.953711%2C-75.940288%2C14.90&showTable=true/" target="_blank">data</a> organized and collected?

The data used for this data sheet has been collected by the Syracuse Police Department. This data is organized based on type of crime reported, address of the crime, if an arrest was made related to the crime, and the specific latitude and longitude of this crime. As this data sheet particularly focuses on the latitude and longitude of crimes in the greater Syracuse area, data was collected if it was considered a major crime (theft, larceny, aggravated assault, and burglary), could be traced back to specific location coordinates within Syracuse, and was within the first half of 2025.

<p> 
Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?

The data collected for this data sheet is newsworthy due to its proximity, significance, and human-interest components that are relevant for members of the Syracuse community. As the data is collected from areas within Syracuse, members of our local community can find interest in this data is it is directly impacting the area they reside in. Furthermore, understanding crime regarding where it is most common, and what types are most common, is newsworthy as it allows residents, as well as those looking to reside in Syracuse, to better understand their personal risk of being impacted by crime, for them to take the necessary safety measures. With this data, individuals in Syracuse can prepare for potential danger by either avoiding high-crime areas, or by adjusting their behaviors by taking more specific precautions. For areas with more theft, individuals might invest in more locks, while for those near areas with more assaults, they may instead invest in personal protective equipment. For many individuals, safety is a top priority.

A good audience for this data would be those looking to move to Syracuse, or those looking to purchase a new home in the area. By using this data, they can evaluate areas that are higher in crime, in order to potentially narrow down their housing search.

What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?

Most crimes associated with a latitude and longitude within the Syracuse area over the first half of 2025 have been larceny.
