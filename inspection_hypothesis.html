The <a href=""<a href=""https://data.syr.gov/datasets/92bcecf4355140a98b9bba3cd8ecdca2_0/explore?location=42.953711%2C-75.940288%2C14.90&showTable=true/" target="_blank">dataset</a> the following hypothesis refrences comes from a collection of Onondaga County establishments that underwent inspection. The dataset is owned by the Bureau of Community Environmental Health and Food Protection. In order to formulate this hypothesis, work was done on <a href=""<a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SgEy7umLUXZlPrPr4RcVXAL9xKMhVJ9ksl0zYXcT-1M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>. My constructed hypothesis is "In Onondaga County, resturants are about 29 times more likely to have critical violations when inspected than taverns." This hypothesis is important as there is sufficient data to support it, and since many people typically selected resturants over taverns, it presents novel and impactful information. Furthermore, since 29 times is a relativley high amount, there is a shock element that consumers will have a reaction to.
