			<p> I am curious to learn more about individuals who have been impacted by changing immigration policies in the Syracuse area, as well as the correlation between deportations and criminal history. From my findings, it appears there is a decrease of individuals being deported with fully-proven criminal backgrounds. In the past, data collection that has been conducted has found that there are few immigrants who have a proven criminal background. An assessment on criminal activity in Syracuse that is public, breaks down crime by demographic.  </p>
