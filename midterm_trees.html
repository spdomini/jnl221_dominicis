Looking ahead, the Bronx will see more than 1,000 tree plantings in the December 2025 season, an almost 50% increase from the previous planting season. In the Janurary 2026 planting season, there are no tree plantings planned for the Manhattan or Staten Island Boroughs, but almost 2750 are planned for Queens. Of the six tree plantings planned for Manhattan in the June 2026 planting season, two are on West End Avenue and two are on Columbus Avenue, with one in city council district three, four in city council six, and one in city council 7. </p>
