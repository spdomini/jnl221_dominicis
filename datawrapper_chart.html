		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p>My story is about house inspections in the city of Syracuse, and how community members are impacted. In Syracuse, house inspections are done by the Code Enforcement agency, with numerous department working under the agency to perform the inspections. For my data visualization, I wanted to highlight which departments in Syracuse are leading the house inspections, and which department is able to resolve/close to most cases regarding to housing violations.</p>

		<!-- STEP TWO: Add the photo of your sketched chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual photo to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->

		<!-- STEP THREE: Add the screenshot of your first Datawrapper chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual screenshot to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p>My partners reccomended that I change the proportions of my bars, and re-write my heading and subheading to ensure my data visualization makes more sense. </p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<<iframe title="The Codes department has the most inspections marked as &quot;Closed,&quot; with 64 more than the BAA department" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Rk3jv" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Rk3jv/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="231" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>
		
		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>For my second data visualization attempt, I changed both the heading and subheading. When making my adjustments, I worked to ensure my visualization was clear, and could stand independently. </p>
